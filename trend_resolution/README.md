Resolve APA trend based on differential CS usage patterns, first at the stop
codon level and then at the gene level.

WARNING: the code is still very sketchy and cannot be used out of the box. I put
it here mainly for illustration purpose. Especially with the test cases (assert
statements), I thought it would be still be clearer than reading psedo-code. I
used the functions in
[one](https://github.com/bcgsc/tasrkleat-TCGA-analysis-scripts/blob/master/analysis-notebooks/core/resolve-APA-trend.ipynb)
of my notebooks.
