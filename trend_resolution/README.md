Resolve APA trend based on differential CS usage patterns, first at the stop
codon level and then at the gene level.

WARNING: the code is still very sketchy and cannot be used out of the box. I put
it here mainly for illustration purpose. Especially with the test cases (assert
statements), I thought it would be more clearer than reading psedo-code. I used
the functions in part of my notebooks.
